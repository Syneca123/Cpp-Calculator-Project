# Simple C++ Calculator

## Project Summary
This project is a simple calculator program written in C++. The program allows a user to input two numbers and choose an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division). It then calculates and displays the result. The problem it solves is performing basic arithmetic in a user-friendly way directly from the console.

## What I Did Well
I structured the program clearly and made the code easy to follow with a clean layout. I also handled division by zero with an error message, which improves the reliability of the program.

## Where I Could Enhance My Code
I could add more features, such as handling multiple calculations without restarting the program, or supporting advanced operations like square roots and exponents. These improvements would make the program more useful and efficient.

## Challenges and How I Overcame Them
The most challenging part was handling errors like dividing by zero. I overcame this by using an if-statement to check the denominator before performing the division. Looking up examples in C++ documentation helped me understand how to handle these cases.

## Transferable Skills
From this project, I practiced:
- Writing readable and maintainable C++ code  
- Using input/output in console programs  
- Applying control structures like switch statements  
- Debugging and testing logic  

These skills will transfer well to future projects in C++ and other programming languages.

## Maintainability, Readability, and Adaptability
I made this program maintainable by using clear variable names and consistent formatting. I kept the logic modular with a switch statement, which makes it easier to expand later (for example, adding new operations). Inline comments explain the code, making it easier for someone else to adapt and build on.
